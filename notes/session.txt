In this week's Java class we learned about data types, and created them. Almost half the people in the class did animal, including my sister.
I did furniture, and my types were bed and sofa. Also for homework I did window. That may seem a little odd, because there aren't many types of windows.
However, I did find a few, and di my program on those, because I didn't want to have the same program as everybody else.
