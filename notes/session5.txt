We worked on programs related to if statements, else statements, else if statements, and for loops, to deepen our knowledge of them and confidence while using them.
We also learned about the variable scanner, and have used it in a few programs. However our limited knowledge of this new variable led to misphaps in our programming.
Another thing we learned about was the steps to writing a program. For example, the first step is to understand the use of the program. What is it suppoed to do?
The second step is do figure out what needs to be done. How are you going to solve this?
The third step is to write the program.
Something else we learned about was another operator, %.
The last thing we learned about was pseudo logic. This has to do with the fact that it is not always correct.
